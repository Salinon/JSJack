<h3>Mission 12.2: Ace as 11 or 1 &mdash; Preparing to Implement Advanced Logic</h3>
<p>Now, on the first line inside the first else statement (the one that surrounds the code determing whether the program should hit), declare a variable that you will set to true if you have an Ace and false if you don't. Then, write an if statement that takes the value returned by the counter function you just wrote and uses it to determine whether this variable should be set to true or false.</p>
<p>Next we need to know what the highest value (without busting) of a hand with Aces in it is. This will require writing another function that takes a parameter that is the number of Aces in the hand. Remember, we will find the highest value of the hand by subtracting 10 from the total value until the value is less than or equal to 21. You cannot subtract ten more times than the number of Aces in your hand. The function should return the highest value. Write this function. Set its value to a variable below where you set a variable for the number of Aces in the hand.</p>
<p>Again, you'll have to check your code against <a show="hidden-1">ours</a>. You'll get to run everything in the next section!</p>
